# RSpec_Calculator

This is a basic calculator produced and tested using the TDD process. The TDD process ensured it followed the red, green and refactor cycle. It also implemented a spec file, created through bash using the command 'rspec --init' to install the RSpec gem.

The RSpec gem is a testing tool used in ruby.
## Spec

The spec file included a file called the spec_helper this is where we would require the file we are using our code in and configure  the RSpec gem that was installed.

We have another rb file in the spec folder, that would need to end with spec for example 'calcualtor_spec.rb'. In this file is where we require the RSpec gem, by requiring the spec_helper file. The TDD process would then be carried out in this file, where all the TDD tests will be carried out.
